Car Registry Tutorial

Car Registry App high level overview
####################################

The Car Registry app is an example of a sidechain that implements specific custom data and logic. The purpose of the application is to manage a simplified service that keeps records of existing cars and their owners. It is simplified as sidechain users will be able to register cars by merely paying a transaction fee. In contrast, in a real-world scenario, the ability to create a car will be bound by the presentation of a certificate signed by the Department of Motor Vehicles or analogous authority, or some other consensus mechanism that guarantees that the car exists in the real world and it’s owned by a user with a given public key.
Accepting that cars will show up in sidechain in our example, we want to build an application that can store information that identifies a specific car, such as vehicle identification number, model, production year, color.
We will also want car owners to prove their ownership of the cars without disclosing information about their identity. We also want users to sell and buy cars against ZEN coins. 


User stories:
#############

1
**Q: I want to add my car to a Car Registry Sidechain.**

*A:* Create a new Car Entry Box, which contains car identification information (Unique car identifier, VIN, manufacturer, model, year, registration number), and certificate. Proposition in this box is my public key in this Sidechain. When I create a box, Sidechain should check car identification information and certificate to be unique in this Sidechain.

2
**Q: I want to create sell order to sell my car using Car Registry Sidechain.**

*A:* I create a new Car Sell Order Box that contains the price in coins and information from the Car Entry Box. So cars can exist in the Sidechain as a Car Entry Box or as a Car Sell Order, but not at the same time. Also, this box contains the buyer’s public key. When I create a sell order, Sidechain should check if there is no other active sell order with this Car Entry Box. The current Sell Order consists of the same information that consists of the Car Entry Box plus description.

3
**Q: I want to see all available Sell orders in Sidechain**

*A:* Have additional storage, which is managed by ApplicationState and stores all Car Sell Orders. All these orders can be retrieved using the new HTTP API call. 


4
**Q: I want to accept a sell order and buy the car.**

*A:* By accepting sell order, I create a new transaction in the Sidechain, which creates a new Car Entry Box with my public key as Proposition and transfers coins amount from me to the previous car owner.

5
**Q: I want to cancel my Car Sell Order.**

*A:* I create a new transaction containing Car Sell Order as input and Car Entry Box with my public key as Proposition as output.

6.
**Q: I want to see my car entry boxes and car sell orders related to me (both created by me and proposed to me).**

*A:* Implement new storage that will be managed by the application state to store this information. Implement a new HTTP API, that contains a new method to get this information.

So, the starting point of the development process is the data representation. A car is an example of a non-coin box because it represents some entity, but not money. Another example of a non-coin box is a car that is selling. We need another box for a selling car because a standard car box does not have additional data like sale price, seller proposition address, etc. For the money representation, standard Regular Box is used (Regular box is coin box), SDK provides that box. Besides new entities CarBox and CarSellOrder, we also need to define a way to create/destroy those new entities. For that purpose, new transactions shall be defined: transaction for creating a new car, a transaction that moves CarBox to CarSellOrder, transaction which declares car selling, i.e., moving CarSellOrder to the new CarBox. All created transactions are not automatically put into the memory pool, so a raw transaction in hex representation shall be put by /transaction/sendTransaction API request. In summary, we will add the next car boxes and transactions:

Special proposition and proof:
##############################

    a) **SellOrderProposition** Standard proposition only contains one public key, i.e., only one specific secret key could open that proposition. 
       However, for a sell order, we need a way to open and spend the box in two different ways, so we need to specify an additional proposition/proof. 
       SellOrderProposition contains two public keys: ``ownerPublicKeyBytes`` and ``buyerPublicKeyBytes``. So the seller or buyer's private keys could open that proposition.
    |
    b) **SellOrderSpendingProof** The proof that allows us to open and spend ``CarSellOrderBox`` in two different ways: opened by the buyer and thus buy the car or opened by the seller and thus recall car sell order. Such proof creation requires two different API calls, but as a result, in both cases, we will have the same type of transaction with the same proof type. 


Transactions:
#############

AbstractRegularTransaction 
**************************

Base custom transaction, all other custom transactions extend this base transaction. 

        *Input parameters are:*
        
            ``inputRegularBoxIds`` - list of regular boxes for payments like fee and car buying
            ``inputRegularBoxProofs`` - appropriate list of proofs for box opening for each regular box in ``inputRegularBoxIds``
            ``outputRegularBoxesData`` - list of output regular boxes, used as the change from paying a fee, as well as a new regular box for payment for the car.
            ``fee`` - transaction fee
            ``timestamp`` - transaction timestamp

        *Output boxes:*
                
            Regular Boxes created by change or car payment 

CarDeclarationTransaction
*************************

Transaction for declaring a car in the Sidechain, this transaction extends ``AbstractRegularTransaction`` thus some base functionality already is implemented. 

        *Input parameters are:*
        
            ``inputRegularBoxIds`` -- list of regular boxes for payments like fee and car buying
            ``inputRegularBoxProofs`` -- appropriate list of proofs for box opening for each regular box in inputRegularBoxIds
            ``outputRegularBoxesData`` -- list of output regular boxes, used as change from paying a fee, as well as a new regular box for car payment.
            ``fee`` -- transaction fee
            ``timestamp`` -- transaction timestamp
            ``outputCarBoxData`` -- box data which contains information about a new car.

        *Output boxes:*
        
            New CarBox with new declared car

SellCarTransaction 
******************

Transaction to initiate the selling process of the car. 

         *Input parameters are:*
         
            ``inputRegularBoxIds`` - list of regular boxes for payments like fee and car buying

        *Output boxes:*
         
            CarSellOrderBox, which represents the car to be sold, that box could be opened by the initial car owner or specified buyer in case if a buyer buys that car.    

BuyCarTransaction 
*****************

This transaction allows us to buy a car or recall a car sell order. 

        *Input parameters are:*
        
            ``inputRegularBoxIds`` - list of regular boxes for payments like fee and purchasing the car 
            ``inputRegularBoxProofs`` - appropriate list of proofs for box opening for each regular box in inputRegularBoxIds
            ``outputRegularBoxesData`` - list of output regular boxes, used as change from paying fee, as well as a new regular box for payment for the car.
            ``fee`` - transaction fee
            ``timestamp`` - transaction timestamp
            ``carBuyOrderInfo`` - information for buy car or recall car sell order.      
            
        *Output boxes:*
        
            Two possible outputs are possible. In the case of buying a car, new CarBox with a new owner, a new Regular box with a value declared in carBuyOrderInfo for the Car's former owner. 

Car registry implementation
###########################

First of all, we need to define new boxes. 
As described before, a Car Box is a non-coin box as defined before we need Car Box Data class to describe custom data. So we need to define CarBox and CarBoxData as separate classes for setting proper way to serialization/deserialization.  

Implementation of CarBoxData:
*****************************

CarBoxData is implemented according description from ``Custom Box Data Creation`` section as ``public class CarBoxData extends AbstractNoncedBoxData<PublicKey25519Proposition, CarBox, CarBoxData>`` with custom data as:

    ::
    
        private final BigInteger vin;
        private final int year;
        private final String model;
        private final String color;
        
Few comments about implementation:

    1. @JsonView(Views.Default.class) is used during class declaration. That annotation allows SDK core to do proper JSON serialization.
    2. Serialization is implemented in  public byte[] bytes() function as well as parsing implemented in public static CarBoxData parseBytes(byte[] bytes) function. SDK developer, as described before, shall include proposition and value into serialization/deserialization. The order doesn't matter. 
    3. CarBoxData shall have a value parameter as a Scorex limitation, but in our business logic, CarBoxData does not use that data at all because each car is unique and doesn't have any inherent value. Thus value is hidden, i.e., value is not present in the constructor parameter and just set by default to "1" in the class constructor.
    4. ``public byte[] customFieldsHash()`` shall be implemented because we introduce some new custom data.
    
Implementation of CarBoxDataSerializer:
***************************************

``CarBoxDataSerializer`` is implemented according to the description from ``Custom Box Data Serializer Creation`` section as ``public class CarBoxDataSerializer implements NoncedBoxDataSerializer<CarBoxData>``. Nothing special to note about.

Implementation of CarBox:
*************************

 ``CarBox`` is implemented according to description from ``Custom Box Class creation`` section as ``public class CarBox extends AbstractNoncedBox<PublicKey25519Proposition, CarBoxData, CarBox>``

Few comments about implementation:

    1. As a serialization part SDK developer shall include ``long nonce`` as a part of serialization, thus serialization is implemented in the following way:
    
        ::
            public byte[] bytes()
            {
             return Bytes.concat(
                 Longs.toByteArray(nonce),
                 CarBoxDataSerializer.getSerializer().toBytes(boxData)
             );
            }

    2. ``CarBox`` defines his own unique id by implementation of the function ``public byte boxTypeId()``. Similar function is defined in ``CarBoxData`` but it is a different ids despite value returned in ``CarBox`` and ``CarBoxData`` is the same.

Implementation of CarBoxSerializer:
***********************************

CarBoxSerializer is implemented according to the description from “Custom Box Data Serializer Creation” section as 
``public class CarBoxSerializer implements BoxSerializer<CarBox>``.  Nothing special to note about.

Implementation of SellOrderProposition
**************************************

``SellOrderProposition`` implemented as ``public final class SellOrderProposition implements ProofOfKnowledgeProposition<PrivateKey25519>``
Nothing special about implementation besides the fact that that proposition contains two public keys, thus that proposition could be opened by two different keys.

Implementation of SellOrderPropositionSerializer
************************************************

``SellOrderPropositionSerializer`` implemented as ``public final class SellOrderPropositionSerializer implements PropositionSerializer<SellOrderProposition>``
Nothing special about implementation

Implementation of SellOrderSpendingProof  
****************************************

``SellOrderSpendingProof implemented as  extends AbstractSignature25519<PrivateKey25519, SellOrderProposition>``

Few comments about implementation: Information about proof type is defined by the result of method boolean isSeller(). For example an implementation of method isValid uses that flag:

    ::
    
        public boolean isValid(SellOrderProposition proposition, byte[] message) {
        if(isSeller) {
        // Car seller wants to discard selling.
        return Ed25519.verify(signatureBytes, message, proposition.getOwnerPublicKeyBytes());
        } else {
        // Specific buyer wants to buy the car.
        return Ed25519.verify(signatureBytes, message, proposition.getBuyerPublicKeyBytes());
        }
        }


Implementation of CarSellOrderBoxData
*************************************

CarSellOrderBoxData is implemented according description from “Custom Box Data Creation” section as public class CarSellOrderData extends AbstractNoncedBoxData<SellOrderProposition, CarSellOrderBox, CarSellOrderBoxData> with custom data as:
private final String vin;
private final int year;
private final String model;
private final String color;


Few comments about implementation:
Proposition and value shall be included in serialization as it done in CarBoxData 
Id of that box data could be different than in CarBoxData
CarSellOrderBoxData  uses custom proposition type, thus *proposition* field have *SellOrderProposition* type 




Implementation of CarSellOrderBoxDataSerializer
***********************************************

CarSellOrderDataSerializer is implemented according to the description from “Custom Box Data Serializer Creation” chapter as 
``public class CarSellOrderBoxDataSerializer implements NoncedBoxDataSerializer<CarSellOrderData>``. 
Nothing special to note about.


Implementation of CarSellOrderBox
*********************************

CarSellorder is implemented according to description from “Custom Box Class creation” :ref:`section <custom-box-class-creation>` as
public final class CarSellOrderBox extends AbstractNoncedBox<SellOrderProposition, CarSellOrderBoxData, CarSellOrderBox>

Nothing special about implementation.



AbstractRegularTransaction
**************************

*AbstractRegularTransaction* is implemented as ``public abstract class AbstractRegularTransaction extends SidechainTransaction<Proposition, NoncedBox<Proposition>>``

Basic functionality is implemented for building required unlockers for input Regular boxes and returning a list of output Regular boxes according to input parameter *outputRegularBoxesData*. Also, basic transaction semantic validity is checked here. 


CarDeclarationTransaction 
*************************

*CarDeclarationTransaction* extends previously declared *AbstractRegularTransaction* in the following way: ``public final class CarDeclarationTransaction extends AbstractRegularTransaction``
newBoxes() -- a new box with a newly created car shall be added as well. Thus that function shall be overridden as well for adding new CarBox additional to regular boxes.  

SellCarTransaction 
******************

*SellCarTransaction* extends previously declared AbstractRegularTransaction in next way: ``public final class SellCarTransaction extends AbstractRegularTransaction``
Similar to *CarDeclarationTransaction, newBoxes()* function shall also return a new specific box. In our case that new box is *CarSellOrderBox*. Also due we have specific box to open (CarBox), we also need to add unlocker for CarBox, so unlocker for that CarBox had been added in ``public List<BoxUnlocker<Proposition>> unlockers()``

BuyCarTransaction
*****************

Few comments about implementation: 
During the creation of unlockers in function *unlockers()*, we need to also create a specific unlocker for opening a car sell order. Another *newBoxes()* function has a bit specific implementation. That function forces to create a new RegularBox as payment for a car in case the car has been sold. Anyway, a new Car box also shall be created according to information in ``carBuyOrderInfo``. 

Extend API: 
***********

* Create a new class CarApi which extends ApplicationApiGroup class, add that new class to Route by it in SimpleAppModule, like described in Custom API manual. In our case it is done in ``CarRegistryAppModule`` by 

    * Creating ``customApiGroups`` as a list of custom API Groups:
    * ``List<ApplicationApiGroup> customApiGroups = new ArrayList<>()````;

    * Adding created ``CarApi`` into ``customApiGroups: customApiGroups.add(new CarApi())``;

    * Binding that custom api group via dependency injection:
      bind(new TypeLiteral<List<ApplicationApiGroup>> () {})
           .annotatedWith(Names.named("CustomApiGroups"))
           .toInstance(customApiGroups);


* Define Car creation transaction.

    * Defining request class/JSON request body
      As input for the transaction we expected: 
      Regular box id  as input for paying fee; 
      Fee value; 
      Proposition address which will be recognized as a Car Proposition; 
      Vehicle identification number of car. So next request class shall be created:
        :: 
           public class CreateCarBoxRequest {
           public String vin;
           public int year;
           public String model;
           public String color;
           public String proposition; // hex representation of public key proposition
           public long fee;


   // Setters to let Akka jackson JSON library to automatically deserialize the request body.

        ::
        
           public void setVin(String vin) {
               this.vin = vin;
           }

           public void setYear(int year) {
               this.year = year;
           }

           public void setModel(String model) {
               this.model = model;
           }

           public void setColor(String color) {
               this.color = color;
           }

           public void setProposition(String proposition) {
               this.proposition = proposition;
           }

           public void setFee(long fee) {
               this.fee = fee;
           }
           }


Request class shall have appropriate setters and getters for all class members. Class members' names define a structure for related JSON structure according to `Jackson library <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/>`_, so next JSON structure is expected to be set: 

    ::
        {
          "vin":"30124",
          “year”:1984,
          “model”: “Lamborghini”
          “color”:”deep black”
        "carProposition":"a5b10622d70f094b7276e04608d97c7c699c8700164f78e16fe5e8082f4bb2ac",
         "fee": 1,
          "boxId": "d59f80b39d24716b4c9a54cfed4bff8e6f76597a7b11761d0d8b7b27ddf8bd3c"
        }
        
Few notes: setter’s input parameter could have a different type than set class member. It allows us to make all necessary conversation in setters.

* Define response for Car creation transaction, the result of transaction shall be defined by implementing SuccessResponse interface with class members which shall be returned as API response, all members shall have properly set getters, also response class shall have proper annotation ``@JsonView(Views.Default.class)`` thus jackson library is able correctly represent response class in JSON format. In our case, we expect to return transaction bytes, so response class is next:

    ::
        @JsonView(Views.Default.class)
        class TxResponse implements SuccessResponse {
           public String transactionBytes;

           public TxResponse(String transactionBytes) {
               this.transactionBytes = transactionBytes;
           }
        }


* Define Car creation transaction itself

    ::
        private ApiResponse createCar(SidechainNodeView view, CreateCarBoxRequest ent)

As a first parameter we pass reference to SidechainNodeView, second reference is previously defined class on step 1 for representation of JSON request. 

* Define request for Car sell order transaction CreateCarSellOrderRequest  similar as it was done for Car creation transaction request

    * Define request class for Car sell order transaction CreateCarSellOrderRequest as it was done for Car creation transaction request:
    
        ::
            public class CreateCarSellOrderRequest {
               public String carBoxId; // hex representation of box id
               public String buyerProposition; // hex representation of public key proposition
               public long sellPrice;
               public long fee;

               // Setters to let Akka jackson JSON library to automatically deserialize the request body.

               public void setCarBoxId(String carBoxId) {
                   this.carBoxId = carBoxId;
               }

               public void setBuyerProposition(String buyerProposition) {
                   this.buyerProposition = buyerProposition;
               }

               public void setSellPrice(long sellPrice) {
                   this.sellPrice = sellPrice;
               }

               public void setFee(int fee) {
                   this.fee = fee;
               }
            }

* Define Car Sell order transaction itself -- ``private ApiResponse createCarSellOrder(SidechainNodeView view, CreateCarSellOrderRequest ent)`` Required actions are similar as it was done to Create Car transaction. The main idea is a moving Car Box into CarSellOrderBox.

* Define Car sell order response --  As a result of Car sell order we could still use TxResponse


 
* Create AcceptCarSellorder transaction
    Specify request as  
    
        ::
            public class SpendCarSellOrderRequest {
               public String carSellOrderId; // hex representation of box id
               public long fee;

               // Setters to let Akka jackson JSON library to automatically deserialize the request body.

               public void setCarSellOrderId(String carSellOrderId) {
                   this.carSellOrderId = carSellOrderId;
               }

               public void setFee(long fee) {
                   this.fee = fee;
               }
            }
            
    * Specify acceptCarSellOrder transaction itself
    * As a result we still could use TxResponse class
    * Important part is creation proof for BuyCarTransaction, because we accept car buying then we shall form proof with defining that we buy car:
        ::
            
            SellOrderSpendingProof buyerProof = new SellOrderSpendingProof(
            buyerSecretOption.get().sign(messageToSign).bytes(),
            isSeller
            );
            
    Where *isSeller* is false.

* Create cancelCarSellOrder transaction

    * Specify cancel request as 
    
        ::
            public class SpendCarSellOrderRequest {
               public String carSellOrderId; // hex representation of box id
               public long fee;

               // Setters to let Akka jackson JSON library to automatically deserialize the request body.

               public void setCarSellOrderId(String carSellOrderId) {
                   this.carSellOrderId = carSellOrderId;
               }

               public void setFee(long fee) {
                   this.fee = fee;
               }
            }
    * Specify transaction itself. Because we recall our sell order then isSeller parameter during transaction creation is set to false.
